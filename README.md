# Project Goal
  1. Develop an engaging and interactive platformer game that captures the attention of players and motivates them to learn Java programming concepts.
  2. Create a tutorial-driven gameplay that gradually introduces and reinforces
  Java concepts, such as variables, data types, loops, and conditionals, through
  gameplay mechanics and challenges.
  3. Implement a visually appealing and user-friendly game interface that makes
  it easy for players to navigate, progress, and track their learning progress.
  4. Design levels with increasing difficulty that require players to apply Java
  programming concepts they have learned in order to solve challenges and
  progress to higher levels.
  5. Provide opportunities for players to practice and reinforce their Java programming skills through coding challenges within the game.
  6. Try to keep the coding challenges simple to not scare away potential new players or to discourage active players.
