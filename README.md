# Introduction
## Abstract from Dissertation
In today's increasingly digitized world, coding has emerged as a critical skill that empowers individuals to shape and navigate the digital landscape. However, traditional methods of learning coding can be complex and daunting, especially for beginners, resulting in a steep learning curve and disengagement. To address this issue, this dissertation presents an innovative approach to learning basic Java coding through an engaging Unity platformer game.

## Running the Project
To run the project, simply download the "FYPUnity.exe" from the code above, this will launch the game. The game is controlled with either standard mouse and keyboard  

WASD or Arrow Keys for Movement  
Space to Jump  
Shift Keys for Walking  
Escape to Spawn  
  
Controller that are compatible with unity should also work, Xbox One controller was used for testing.

## The Minor Dissertation for this project will contain 7 Major Category
  1. Introduction
  2. Methodology
  3. Technology Review
  5. System Design
  6. System Evaluation 
  7. Conclusion

# Project Description
This is a Unity3D project. The game is a platformer, and the goal of the game is to progress to the end while learning about java coding practices.

## Projects Goals
  1. Develop an engaging and interactive platformer game that captures the attention of players and motivates them to learn Java programming concepts.
  2. Create a tutorial-driven gameplay that gradually introduces and reinforces
  Java concepts, such as variables, data types, loops, and conditionals, through
  gameplay mechanics and challenges.
  3. Implement a visually appealing and user-friendly game interface that makes
  it easy for players to navigate, progress, and track their learning progress.
  4. Design levels with increasing difficulty that require players to apply Java
  programming concepts they have learned in order to solve challenges and
  progress to higher levels.
  5. Provide opportunities for players to practice and reinforce their Java programming skills through coding challenges within the game.
  6. Try to keep the coding challenges simple to not scare away potential new players or to discourage active players.
  
  ## Project Technologies
  1. Unity Engine: For creation of the Video Game
  2. Github: For project version control and management
  3. Mixamo: For character creation and animations
  4. Overleaf: For Dissertation creation

## Project Conclusion
This dissertation has presented a project that aimed to develop a video game using the Unity game engine, Mixamo for character animation, Overleaf for collaborative writing and publishing, and GitHub for version control and project management. The project was successful in achieving its primary goal of creating a functional game that incorporated all of these tools. The game features a unique concept, character looks, and game mechanics that were developed and implemented using Unity. Although it is not without faults, I am satisfied with how it turned out in the overall picture. I was concerned about designing the main character for the game since it is not my forte. However, with the help of some research and Mixamo, I was able to develop a system that made the character feel more lifelike and appropriate for the project.
